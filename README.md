## Project Description

### Motivation
Anthropogenic impacts are rapidly altering historic environmental conditions, with consequences across ecological scales, including reduced fitness in *individuals*, reduced *population* sizes, and reduced diversity in *communities*. It remains unclear whether these effects are consistent across ecological scales (i.e., similar in direction and magnitude) or become amplified or reduced with increasing ecological complexity. For example, declines in fitness and population sizes in some species within a community could be offset by increased performance of others (due to direct effects of environmental change and/or indirect effects arising from changes in competitive dynamics), such that community-level properties are unaffected. 

### Question
*Are the effects of environmental drivers consistent across ecological scales?*

### Approach
Body size is known to be a strong predictor of fitness in fish, and changes in body size are likely to have impacts at the population and community levels. Leveraging long-term (5+ year) records of marine and aquatic fish communities, we will fit hierarchical models to evaluate how changes in water temperature affect individuals (i.e., fish length), populations (counts), and communities (Shannon's diversity and total community size).
