## Contributing Guidelines & Style Guide

When you have a group of people collaborating on a shared project (particularly a code-heavy one), it can be nice to create some guidelines to make sure everyone is contributing in consistent ways. Similarly if your group reaches consensus on a 'style' of file names and/or code it can be good to formalize those rules as well. The standard convention in GitHub is to create a file called "CONTRIBUTING.md" that contains all of this information. If you want some inspiration check out the LTER Scientific Computing team's [CONTRIBUTING.md](https://github.com/lter/scicomp/blob/main/CONTRIBUTING.md) document!
